BlackNoise Â» Like GreyNoise, but with Garden instead of TAL
=============================================================

== What is it? ==

An implementation of the WhiteNoise static website
generation system, but in Perl 5 instead of Perl 6,
and with Garden templates instead of TAL templates.

The first Perl 5 implementation was called GreyNoise,
and like the original WhiteNoise, it used TAL for templates.
However, Template::TAL was manging the Unicode characters
in templates, so I wrote BlackNoise which originally had it's own
template system using parsed Perl templates (EVIL!)

Since then, I designed Garden, to be a next-generation template engine,
and have moved BlackNoise to using Garden instead.

== What dependencies are there? == 

 * Perl 5.10 or higher.
 * File::Find::Rule
 * Slurp
 * DateTime
 * JSON (2.0 or higher. JSON::XS is also highly recommended.)
 * XML::LibXML
 * UNIVERSAL::require
 * version
 * Test::XML
 * Garden (https://github.com/supernovus/garden-perl5/)
 * DateTime::Format::Perl6
   Used to be bundled, now it's in its own repository.
   See https://github.com/supernovus/datetime-format-perl6

== What's next? ==

Nothing. This is meant as a stop-gap solution to power my website.
It's not fully featured, and never will be.

Eventually I hope Perl 6 gets to the point where I can resurrect
WhiteNoise, and maybe merge it into ww6. Of course, that's just a dream.
